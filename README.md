### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Mobile app dev who's currently invested in the React Native Open source space...
I'm looking to collaborate on React Native projects that leverage considerable platform(Android & iOS) APIs...that's where the fun is ðŸ¥¶.

My past works...
- Pickmeup rider on [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pickmeup.rider) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ng/app/pickmeup-rider/id1423542581) 
- More navigation apps such as [Exalt Rider](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exalt.rider) and [Logistics](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.userlogistics)

Sometimes(once in a blue moon) I write my thoughts on [medium](https://medium.com/@malcolmtomisin)
